Known for her love of current events, history and Model United Nations, Selin is very much in- terested in international relations and affairs. Ever since the 6th grade, Selin has been participating in Model Unit- ed Nations. To be honest, she joined because a freshman in her school told her it would help her with her college applications. In the beginning, she was an admin and she instantly enjoyed the feeling of watching a conference. So, she did not only settle for admin, but became a delegate. She has always liked the idea of dressing up, being formal, and the fancy atmosphere one feels during conferences. Aside from Model United Nations, Selin has been actively partic- ipating in writing articles for newspapers, whether school or outside of school. What you may not know is that not only does she write for Catalysm, she also writes for an online newspaper called the United Youth Journalists. This is a newspaper which is creat- ed by students from all around the world to de- liver perspectives of the youth on issues from all around the world. Selin has always had an interest in the media in general. In regards to her passion, Selin has multiple interests. Everything from edu- cation to neuropsychology. When she was younger, she actually wanted to be a teacher for a short period of time. However, she is still continu- ing to search for what exactly she wants to do in her life. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="45"><p data-reactid="46"> “I feast on awkwardness” </p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="47"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="49"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="50"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="51"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6fa219bab7654e8099e558ff93c13955/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F36f47f8b1b267c27d2871ff3d9e62319%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D5472%26cropwidth%3D3649%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Ff3f48491-b71c-4d46-b721-42fed02ae79e.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:57.33291655248013% 47.998046875%;" data-reactid="52"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/07717f4dca20fa296d0ad016b72b1e2c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F36f47f8b1b267c27d2871ff3d9e62319%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D5472%26cropwidth%3D3649%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Ff3f48491-b71c-4d46-b721-42fed02ae79e.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:57.33291655248013% 47.998046875%;" data-reactid="53"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a9f3ac6d9bb4446f2ae81e8e6d70f1be/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F36f47f8b1b267c27d2871ff3d9e62319%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D5472%26cropwidth%3D3649%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Ff3f48491-b71c-4d46-b721-42fed02ae79e.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=720" style="object-position:57.33291655248013% 47.998046875%;" data-reactid="54"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c12c28ba3410664beb58963e9b47e5cb/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F36f47f8b1b267c27d2871ff3d9e62319%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D5472%26cropwidth%3D3649%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Ff3f48491-b71c-4d46-b721-42fed02ae79e.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=360" style="object-position:57.33291655248013% 47.998046875%;" data-reactid="55"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="3649" data-height="5472" data-ratio="0.6668494152046783" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6fa219bab7654e8099e558ff93c13955/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F36f47f8b1b267c27d2871ff3d9e62319%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D5472%26cropwidth%3D3649%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Ff3f48491-b71c-4d46-b721-42fed02ae79e.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:57.33291655248013% 47.998046875%;" data-reactid="56"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="57"><!-- react-empty: 58 --><!-- react-empty: 59 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="60"><h1 data-reactid="61"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="62"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="63">Rex Kingston</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 64 --><!-- react-empty: 65 --><div class="Paragraph color-text " data-reactid="66"><p data-reactid="67">His past filled with ups and downs galore, Rex views himself as your average kid, though eaning slightly towards the negative side.
