# Haruka Tone

Many people may perceive Haruka as a quiet girl, do not let this blind you. Haruka actually describes herself as a person who loves to break the status quo, break the rules, and be loud. She loves to explore the world and make nature her own.

Speaking of nature, there is no place Haruka loves more than the beach. Since she grew up near it, it was rather easy for her to explore the beach before she came home. At times, she would stay there until 8pm in her cave she made near the rocks of the shore.

To her, the best thing in the world would be drinking a banana smoothie while watching the ocean. Whenever she had problems or something to think about, she would gaze into the ocean and spend time there as she en- joyed the beauty of the blue sky, the stars and the breeze of the ocean. Despite her love for nature, the one thing Haruka hates the most is spiders. When she was a kid, she actually dreamt of a spider two times larger than her, eating her alive. Ever since then, she would never ever appreciate a spider.

Haruka is most passionate about solving the issue of bullying through education. Actu- ally, when she was younger, she had first hand experience with bullying. As a result, Haruka says that she has trouble expressing her emo- tions honestly with herself or with other peo- ple. At times, she would spend time away from her duties and create an environment in her mind where she could escape and relax. She does not like this habit, but she accepts it and wants to change it.

Today, Haruka wishes to become some- one who can help people who are going through the same bullying phase she went through. She hopes to train teachers in local Japanese schools to help notice when bullying occurs to prevent this issue in the future.
