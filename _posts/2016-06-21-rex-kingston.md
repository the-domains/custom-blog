# Rex Kingston

His past filled with ups and downs galore, Rex views himself as your average kid, though eaning slightly towards the negative side. For instance, he sees himself as a "spoiled brat" who

as been presented with everything by his parents since childhood and because of this, was onstantly taking things for granted. He has always been hard on himself for not being the

est that he could; this way of thinking has persisted up to this day. Despite the myriad flaws ex believes he possesses, there is equally plenty on his good side as well. He has a strong

work ethic and enjoys wor-king moderately. Refusing to neglect his family life, Rex spends oughly an equal amount of time with both of his parents. Even with his social life, Rex has re- ently been trying to be more open to people around him as well, strangers and friends alike.

Originally born in Japan to an Aussie dad and Japanese mom, Rex has been exposed to five ifferent environments worldwide up to this point, having lived in Japan, Malaysia, Saudi

Arabia, Singapore, and Australia in the past. The one place he connects to the most, however, s Singapore, after spending six years there in a rigorous academic setting.

Though generic, Rex's interests are nevertheless widespread and eclectic. He loves to ex- ose himself to music all the time no matter where he is and enjoys numerous genres - except op music. His thirst for music began early on in his childhood with his dad gifting him mu-

ic discs; young Rex was all but captivated from then on. Additionally, Rex identifies himself as a fairly athletic person, mainly focusing on rugby and basketball. Coming to ISAK, Rex has

ound an athletic environment much more casual than previous ones - where competition is ot the norm. Going along with his musical and athletic sides is Rex's academic persona. Rex

s a voracious reader and devours books of the mystery genre. He admits that he has not been reading as much since coming here and is looking to pick up the pace again in the upcoming months.

It might be hard to tell at first glance, but Rex has plenty of goals he hopes to fulfill. Some more feasible than others. Overall, his lifetime goal is to lead a balanced life: a mix be- ween the social, education, and physical aspects. Just for the rest of this year, he is aiming to hange his attitude towards learning, staunchly believing that the marks will naturally follows long as he rectifies how he approaches his studies. By the age of fifty, Rex wants to have lready settled down in a rural location away from the cities. In the time between graduaion and "settling down", Rex dreams of either playing in the NBA or in the Australian Rugby eam. Add 'bachelor' onto that list, and it's a dream come true for the Rex.
