# Boom Tongsamui

Probably known as the clown of the Class of 2017, Boom has always enjoyed making people laugh, being cheerful and silly, but also doing embarrassing things. Boom believes if you do not believe something is embarrassing, you can have the time of your life.

Despite all this, Boom can have a serious side. He describes himself as lazy, although that does not mean he does not excel in his studies. Boom may not study much, but it is because he believes that if you understand the basic concept of the subject then you can easily understand the rest. Build a foundation in order to create a pyramid. Among all the subjects, he says that he relates most to science and economics. Mostly because he can easily make connections to the real world in these subjects. He is not the type to study intensely but rather to understand the basics. Be- cause he can understand the basic, he tends to spend his time on activ- ities that make him happy like video games, football, watching movies and anime among other things.

Speaking of which, football was a sport which Boom has excelled at. He began playing around 7 years ago. Initially, he played to socialize and because it was a sport his friends played. He began to play for the school team in the 5th grade. Actually, on his debut game,he came in as a substitute for center midfield, and scored the winning goal. This was Boom as a football player.

Today, Boom is currently look- ing for his passion as he explores different interests. He continues to smile and make people laugh, but there are other sides of Boom which this article does not emit.
