February. Wednesday evening. She sits in the cafeteria, in her hard core typing position, typing it all away. Her written task was due that evening. Clicking the print but- ton, she races upstairs to fetch the rubric from the printer and - oh lord. He came down the stairs, nonchalance and attitude in his step, his hair jutting out at the right angle, un- zipped familiar sweater, lazy sweatpants. His appearance made it obvious he put in less than zero effort to look good. Either the straight-out-of-bed look on Saturday mornings, or suited up on thanksgiving dinners, his attitude and appearance hit her hard.</p><p></p><p>She saw him, and forgot about her IA. Forgot about homework. Forgot about her fam- ily. Forgot about the holidays. Nothing else mattered any more. He looked like a movie star. His freshness, aura and appeal; all in the right proportions. The cologne he used, the colours of his clothes, the precision of his table manners, it got her swinging. Her stom- ach clenched into a tight knot, but she felt a lightness and simplicity through every vein of her body. She had the energy to fly; but the passive charisma he brought with every step blew her away. His face was this sinful, irresistible indulgence. It turned her on. ‘Hey’, he said, giving her that relaxed, casual smile, crossing her on the stairs. Wait. What just happened? Her head was high in the clouds. She possessed the collective energy of the audience at a rock concert, the crisp relief of jumping into the swimming pool on a hot summer day, and the joy of a university graduate receiving his first salary.</p><p></p><p>The two paragraphs illustrate a cliched high-school romance story. This feeling is given such importance that a whole day of the year, the 14th of February, is dedicated to the theme of romance and intimacy.</p><p></p><p>Love is an amazing feeling. Whether for a person, habit or a hobby; converting it into a passion, love has the power to affect psychology of decision making, switch mood and mindset, and change character. Besides being just an ‘emotion’ like happiness, sadness, anger or frustration, love lasts longer and is more powerful.</p><p></p><p>At another level, it could be argued that love (not restricted to romance alone) is irrational and worthless. When we’re zoned or influenced by emotion, we can’t see long term or the supposed reality. But this isn’t always true; consider the love you hold for your parents or family. Human relationships shaped by love cannot be defined by numbers or facts; and the bond holding you to your passion, painting, photography, film or dance cannot be measured by any worth. Love is an emotion that adds a softness in life and makes us hu- man. Besides instilling a personally amazing feeling, an individual or collective feeling of love can give faith, belief, realisation, or just pure happiness.</p><p></p><p>For instance:</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is willing to donate $45 billion USD, or 99% of Facebook shares, through the joy he felt once his daughter Max was born.</p><p>Sonnets from around the world are written to describe love in different forms, from Shake- speare to EE Cunningham, giving cultural and social insight into deep and indescribable emotion.</p><p>From filmmaking to creating valentine’s cards, imagine how many businesses would close down if love did not exist.</p><p>Sites of Sikh worship, Gurudwaras, distribute free food and meals as a way of serving the community, owing to their love for god.</p><p>Pop music, by artists like Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Taylor Swift or Adele; frame an abstract concept of romance through music, earning their livelihood and adding on to ‘the chain of human legacy’</p><p>There’s a strong fight going on for LGBT rights with tags like #pride and #Lovewins, in de- veloping countries, especially in Asia, to break conservative beliefs.</p><p></p><p>And then you have Valentine’s Day. In my opinion, Valentine’s Day is absurd because it’s solely dedicated to lovers and couples. ‘Love’ is pure and limitless joy, faith or passion which you could hold for simply anything. Love for yourself, for another person, or just seeing the world become a better place can add kindness and devotion to our character. This frames the concept of humanity; and where would humans be if humanity didn’t ex- ist? To end this article, I’d like to quote Nicholas Sparks from his novel, The Notebook.</p><p></p><p>“The best love is the kind that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. That’s what I hope to give you for- ever.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone!</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">THE PARADOX OF LOVE</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
